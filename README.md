# It's a appointment management web application for doctors and patients
Patients can book an appointment using this web application and Doctor's can manage their appointments and can accept or reject appointment requests made by the patients. It makes the appointment management system much easier for both the patients and the doctor.

I have added chat system with the existing system. It gives the doctors and the patients opportunity to open rooms and share passwords. People with the password of a specific room will be able to communicate among themselves using the room.
